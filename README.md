# *PUDDING*
*a PROOF tool*

## Outline

PUDDING allows users to build complex queries against (Toronto) GIS data in order to find viable sites for PROOF projects, as well as determining scalable markets for development. A user can filter based on property-specific metrics (frontage, dimensions, zoning, etc) as well as by a site's proximity to other datapoints (infrastructure, other properties, schools, etc) in order to isolate for properties of interest.

### Property-level data

### Filtering

### Mapping

### Additional GIS Layers, Buffering + Proximity Queries

PUDDING will make use of many other GIS layers provided by the City of Toronto and other sources, such as school locations, subway/bus stops, and any other relevant layers PROOF requires (easily added into the database and tool whenever new data is necessary). The layers can be incorporated into a filter in order to isolate sites based on proximity to (or distance from) these locations.

### vX.0 + Vision

- all sites that are x dimensions on corners 
- proximities to infrustructure (subways, buses)
- e.g. 30 ft wide corner lots wihin 1km of a bus station
